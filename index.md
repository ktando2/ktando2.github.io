<div class="lead pretty-links">
  I’m interested in the collision between culture + technology. Technology is increasingly reshaping every part of our lives, and society. Technology has quickly gone from being its own industry, to impacting every part of the global economy, and our lives.

I’m also a firm believer in the idea that we need to rethink the way businesses are built. We need to emphasize sustainability, values, and a mission beyond simple making money. Businesses that operate at the intersection of profit + purpose will have the most appeal in a rapidly evolving economy being redefined by the modern consumer.

I’m open with what I’m thinking about online because I believe conversation, and debate are the best avenues to learn from others. Feel free to check out my blog, notes, and Twitter account to learn more about me.

Please reach out if you’d like to chat, work on a project together, or grab coffee in NYC.

desc:  Adios, Blackberry

iPhone vs. Blackberry.  This is an internal battle I have been having since the iPhone came out in 2007.  I am a self admitted Apple fan boy.  I waited on line for several hours outside my local AT&T store when the original iPhone was being released and paid the absurd price tag of $600 for an iPhone.  The original iPhone was my first smartphone, and this was around the time that many of my friends were getting their first smartphones as well, but the majority of them opted for Blackberries.  At first I could not understand why anyone would not want the iPhone until I realized I was the one being left out of their exclusive world of Blackberry Messenger (BBM).  BBM is essentially texting, except you can see when your message has been delivered, and the more exciting part…when your message has been read by the recipient!  All my friends were using BBM, and found it irritating to communicate with me via plain old text messages, at least I hope that is the reason they were irritated.  I eventually caved in to my fear of missing out (FOMO) and switched to Blackberry to join the crowd.  

Several years have passed since I made that decision, and for the most part I have been happy with my Blackberry.  The Blackberry has instant push email, a physical keyboard, the ability to insert a backup battery, and the ever important BBM.  Even with all these advantages over the iPhone in the past few months I have found myself having iPhone envy, and I am ready to switch back due to several factors:

1) The application ecosystem has improved drastically for iOS since the original iPhone was released.  For almost everything you can think you would want your phone to do “there is an app for that.”

2) Many of my BBM friends have now left their Blackberries for Android and the iPhone, especially since Verizon now carries the iPhone.  This has made BBM less of a factor for me to keep a Blackberry.

3) The app ecosystem for Blackberries ranges from awful to almost non-existent.  Most new apps either do not have a Blackberry version of their app, or if they do it is a stripped down far inferior version to their Android and iOS counterparts.

In conclusion, when the iPhone 5 is finally released (hopefully this summer) I will once again be at my local AT&T or Apple store waiting happily in line for hours.

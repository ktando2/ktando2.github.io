title: Kickstarter: Build Your Product, Build Your Base
desc: Building relationships with your earliest supporters

I love Kickstarter. I think it is an incredibly powerful platform, that enables people to transform their dreams into a reality, while building a strong community around that dream. I recently backed Nice Laundry- a fresh start for your sock drawer. For anyone who is planning on running a Kickstarter campaign in the future, I think it is important to see how Ricky & Phil, the guys behind Nice Laundry interacted with their backers throughout the entire Kickstarter creation/fulfillment process.

Here are some of the things they did that really stood out to me:

1) Replied to every question promptly, politely, and with enthusiasm.

In every interaction with backers/potential backers, Ricky and Phil’s passion, and excitement about the project came through. You want to root for people who are truly in love with what they are working on.

2) Under promise and over deliver.

After the project quickly reached its funding goal, the guys went for a stretch goal by activating their base of supporters. If they reached a certain amount in funding everyone was getting an exclusive pair of Kickstarter backer socks…FOR FREE. They already had our money, and our support…and they decided to give us free socks. This is how you gain fans, and loyal customers.

3) Make people apart of the journey, and they will be more invested in the outcome.

The Nice Laundry team went above and beyond with some of their updates to backers. As they traveled to Asia to visit the factory where our socks would be made, they shared an entire photo journal of the trip, detailing who was making the socks, the process by which the socks would be made, and the background of the people producing the socks in the factory. We got a unique insight into manufacturing in Asia, about products that would soon be in our hands…err on our feet!

4) Managing expectations.

When you’re creating something new to put out into the world, it is tough to stick to a strict schedule. Things happen, there are always unforeseen circumstances that arise, and crises to deal with. Ricky & Phil gave us insight into how the socks would be packaged, put on a ship, and brought to America, and then clear customs, before being shipped out to backers. Once again, they provided a ton of information, along with pictures on what this process would be like. If there was going to be a delay, we know that they did everything that they could to prevent it, but they also gave us insight into how a lot of the later parts of the journey were even out of their control.

5) Transparency.

Ricky and Phil were incredibly transparent throughout the entire process, as the above examples show. When there was a slight delay in the socks arriving, they were quick to communicate that there would be a small delay because of customs, and that they would work quickly to get our socks to us as soon as they got them. They arrived a day before promised!

6) Build a lasting relationship with your customer, as you continue to build your company.

The socks arrived, and they were great. There was a personal, handwritten note from Ricky & Phil saying thanks for helping to make the project happen. Backers also received an email from them detailing how they could follow them on social media (they are very active). They encourage people to share pictures of themselves wearing their new Nice Laundry socks, and are very responsive on Facebook and Twitter.

I felt like I got to experience the journey from having a dream about making socks, all the way to getting them on people’s feet. Throughout the process, the Nice Laundry team’s passion, drive, and commitment to the backer was obvious, thus earning them not only my business, but an evangelist for the brand, and their products. I’m excited to see what they come up with next.

Kickstarter allows creators to not only find financial backing for a creative project, but also provides them with the perfect platform to build a relationship with their first customers over an extended period of time. The backers are the people who are supporting your dream, with the knowledge that they might see nothing in return if it doesn’t work out. It is important for creators to make backers feel that they are apart of the process of turning the dream into a reality. Bigger brands should take note, and try to replicate some elements of this relationship with their customers, it will serve them well moving forward.

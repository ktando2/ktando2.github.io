title: My Smartphone Is Still Kind of Dumb
desc: Smartphones still have a ton of room for improvement
---

I have an iPhone. It is incredible. It packs more power than a top of the line computer did six years ago, and fits inside my pocket. It let’s me do email, browse the web, take pictures, maintain a schedule, set reminders, take notes, take videos, video chat with people anywhere in the world, get directions, read books, conduct financial transactions, and countless other things. But my iPhone, is also a phone. It let’s me send, and receive phone calls, and check voicemail…basically the same thing a phone did ten years ago. I want the phone component of my smartphone, to become as amazing as the other stuff on the device.

Phone wishlist:

1) Smart lists: Let me put my contacts into different lists, so I can assign different privileges, and set various functionality for different groups of people. This will be important for my other wishes.

2) Away Message: On AIM, and Google Talk you can set an away message- away from computer, at the movies, a funny quote, whatever you want. Give me the ability to do this with texts and phone calls. It could work two different ways.

a) Texts- I assign a certain list of people who will receive an away message if they contact me. When someone from that lists texts me, they will receive a message: “In a movie, will get back to you after 10 PM.” They could possibly just see this message when they go to enter my name to text- letting them know, right now is not a good time to get in touch with me, or let them decide if they want to send it anyway.

b) Something similar could work with voicemail- “The person you are trying to reach is currently at the gym, he will call you back as soon as he is finished.” People could just type these in, and have a computer voice update their voicemail greeting for a group on a select list.

3) The address book needs to become more dynamic. Let people easily be placed into different groups, and allow contacts to broadcast a status message. WhatsApp does this currently, I want to see if it in default iPhone Address Book. Let me preset calls for specific moments in time, and show me a reminder 15 minutes before.

The psychology around accessibility has changed. People feel that they are expected to be accessible through their mobile devices all the time, and the person on the other end of the phone is often expecting that level access. If we are able to clearly communicate what we are doing, or why we cannot speak right now, we might be able to set some clear boundaries about personal time vs time I’m willing to talk. I don’t know what the technical barriers are to implementing some of these wishes, but I hope we see some changes, and innovative updates to the phone part of the incredible handheld computers we all carry in our pockets.

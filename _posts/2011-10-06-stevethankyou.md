Dear Mr. Jobs,

Tonight I was in a Skillshare class about mentors. Towards the end of the class on the instructor’s projected laptop screen, a tweet popped up, you had just passed away.  It seems fitting that I was in New York City’s Dogpatch Labs surrounded by other young entrepreneurs who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, learning about mentors, considering you have been my biggest mentor even though we will never meet.

In these early moments after feeling sadness for your family, friends, and those who had the pleasure of working with you, I cannot help but think of the tremendous legacy you are leaving behind.  The Apple II, the Mac line, iPods, iPhones, iPads, iTunes, Pixar, and so many of your other creations have reshaped the way entire world consumes, connects, and communicates with the world around them.  But I think to stop there with your legacy would be selling your contributions to the world very short.  Rather, I think your true, and most lasting impact on the world will be the generations of dreamers, creators, and innovators who will follow your lessons, and who will always be asking themselves “What would Steve do?”  You have inspired so many to possess a tremendous focus,  pay great attention to detail, and have the desire to not only see what is possible, but to try and create the impossible.

I could sit here and write pages on your once in a lifetime career, all the wise words you have said over the years, or detail your extraordinary journey from being a baby given up for adoption to arguably the most important businessman the world will ever see.  People will write those stories, but I simply wanted to share that I will continue to live my life personally, and professionally with the lessons you taught me- of continuing to do what makes me happy, loving my work, and always striving for better.  It has still not hit me the magnitude of your loss to me personally, or to society as a whole, and I might not realize the impact until a few years from now.  No matter what happens with Apple in the future, your legacy is forever cemented in the hearts, and minds of every person who wishes to make ding in the world like you hoped to do so many years ago. Congratulations Steve I think you accomplished your mission, but I can’t help but wonder what could have been if you had more time on this earth, that is one answer I will never get. I am appreciative for the short time that you were given to make a lasting impact on the world.

Forever staying hungry, and forever staying foolish.
